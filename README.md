# A custom dialogue graph system for Unity

Currently in development and <b><ins>does not feature the dialogue system itself</ins></b>, only the graph view and some nodes.

To install, put the "Lifty's Dialogue System" into the Assets/Plugins folder (necessary for styles).

Graph view system made thanks to livestreams from Game Dev Guide (https://www.youtube.com/@GameDevGuide) with some tweaks to fit my system.
